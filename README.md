## Brief Introduction âœ¨ ##
***
* **Motivation:** Arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR) for remote sensing (RS) images suffered from the challenge of the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sever degradation of high-frequency details. We proposed EESCit with the capability of enhancing edge feature and sensitivity of valid signal information.
* **Innovation:** An Edge Enhanced Module (EEM) with echo-shaped feature propagation pathways and adaptively parameterized Sobel operators is developed to achieve edge-aware feature recalibration, preserving structural continuity in edge regions. In addition, a cascaded framework combining spatial and channel information enhancement operations (SCEM) is incorporated into the algorithm to suppress interference noise and enhance discriminative features in RS imagery.
